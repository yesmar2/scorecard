# Tracker Concept

This is just the beginning stages of a golf scorecard progressive web application.  I feel that a lot of scorecard apps on the market these days are over complicated and contain too much unimportant functionality.  My goal with this is to concentrate on simplicity and user experience and to one day have all the players in my golf league to track their scores.
