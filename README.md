# Tracker Concept

This is just the beginning stages of a golf scorecard progressive web application. I feel that a lot of scorecard apps on the market these days are over complicated and contain too much insignificant functionality. My goal with this is to concentrate on simplicity and user experience and to one day have all the players in my golf league use it to track their scores.

## Stack

-   React
-   Redux
-   styled-components
-   animated

## Short Term Goals

-   Only looks good in portrait mode for mobile devices. Need to work on responsiveness for larger devices as well as landscape.
-   Add prop-types for type-checking
-   Add unit and integration tests
